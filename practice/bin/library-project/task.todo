Task: Create a Simple Library Management System
Requirements:

Book Class:
Properties: title, author, publicationYear, isAvailable

Methods: borrow(), returnBook(), isAvailable()

Library Class:
Property: books (a list of Book objects)

Methods: addBook(), removeBook(), searchBookByTitle(), searchBookByAuthor()
Main Function:

Create a Library object.
Add some books to the library.
Allow the user to borrow and return books.
Display the available books.
Additional Considerations:

You can implement a system to track the borrower's name for each borrowed book.
Consider adding a feature to calculate overdue fines for books that are not returned on time.
Example Output:

Available Books:
1. The Lord of the Rings
2. Pride and Prejudice
3. To Kill a Mockingbird
This task incorporates OOP concepts by defining classes with properties and methods,
representing real-world entities (books and a library). It also demonstrates the use of
object relationships and interactions.
